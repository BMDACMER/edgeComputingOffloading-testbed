### Multi-hop Task Offloading in Edge Computing: a Diffusion-reward Imitation Learning Approach

This manuscript is currently under peer review, and our research has been validated on an experimental testbed. The technical documentation will be made publicly available upon acceptance. In the meantime, interested readers can explore our prior [work](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10473221) on edge computing [testbeds](https://github.com/lhc0512/edge-computing-testbed).
